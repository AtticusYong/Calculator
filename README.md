# Calculator

The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.

The calculator is something used for making mathematical calculations, in particular a small electronic device with a keyboard and a visual display.
